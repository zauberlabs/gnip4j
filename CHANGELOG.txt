    final GnipStream stream = x.createPowertrackStream(String.class)
        .withAccount("…")
        .withType("dev")
        .withUnmarshall(new StringUnmarshaller())
        .withObserver(new StreamNotificationAdapter<String>() {
            @Override
            public void notify(final String activity, final GnipStream stream) {
                System.out.println(activity);
            }
